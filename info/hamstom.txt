Requirements:

1. We need to mimic Create Listing from https://trustmypetsitter.com to 
https://trustmypetsitter.herokuapp.com.


2. When user clicks on Create Listing he will be redirected to a page where he will be
able to pick wheter he is a Pet Owner / Pet Sitter / Pet Services. That will basically
be categories which will then have different questions.


3. So after user for example click Pet Service he will have a different questions while creating
listing.


4. The code as you may seen on REPO is a React App, and the support told me that for this
programmer needs Redux experience.


5. Please provide us with estimate time on how long will you need to finish this job?
We need it done by the friday is it possible?
